It was established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as part of efforts to curb unwanted calls, particularly those intended for a phone number’s former owner. When a number is reassigned, callers might inadvertently reach a new consumer who never gave consent, which can be annoying to the recipient and can expose the caller to liability under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The RND’s purpose is to help voice service providers and businesses determine <i>before placing a call</i> whether a phone number has been disconnected (and thus possibly reassigned) since the time the original consent was obtained.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>How it works:</b> Voice service providers (like Telnyx) report permanently disconnected U.S. phone numbers into the RND on an ongoing basis (typically monthly). The official RND system (accessible at reassigned.us) allows registered callers to query a phone number with a date of last contact or consent. The database will respond with one of three results – “Yes,” “No,” or “No Data” – indicating the status of that number since the provided date. A “Yes” means the number <i>has</i> been permanently disconnected (i.e. likely reassigned) after your provided date, so calling it could reach the wrong person. A “No” means the number has not been disconnected since that date, suggesting it still belongs to the same consumer (this “No” result is what grants a safe harbor if it later turns out the number was reassigned). “No Data” means the database has no record for the query (for example, if the consent date was before the RND started tracking in 2021), and in that case no safe harbor applies.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Regulatory background:</b> The FCC’s 2018 order created the RND to address calls to reassigned numbers on a nationwide scale. Since November 2021, the RND has been fully operational for paid subscribers (callers) to use in their compliance workflows. The FCC requires all telephone service providers to supply their disconnected number data to the RND, making it a comprehensive resource covering all U.S. geographic and toll-free numbers. Telnyx, as a service provider, complies by submitting monthly reports of numbers that have been permanently disconnected. (Telnyx also offers customers a 15-day window to reclaim a number after disconnecting it, before it gets reported as permanently disconnected in the next RND update.) This industry-wide reporting ensures that when you query the RND, you’re getting up-to-date information on whether a number has changed hands. </p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_e116ba3121\"><b>Who is Required to Use the RND?</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">Businesses making outbound calls or texts to U.S. numbers are required by law to check the RND when relying on prior consumer consent to contact those numbers. In practice, any entity that places telemarketing, informational, or automated calls/SMS should be using the RND to verify numbers. This includes Telnyx customers such as contact centers, CPaaS providers, sales and marketing platforms, debt collectors, and robocall/auto-dialer operators – essentially, if your organization sends outbound voice calls or text messages to consumers, you need to ensure the number you’re dialing still belongs to the same person who gave you consent.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Under the TCPA and FCC rules, callers must have consent from the current subscriber of a telephone number. Because phone numbers frequently get reassigned to new users, the FCC has eliminated the old “one-call” exception and instead provided a safe harbor for callers who properly use the RND. This means that to comply with the law and avoid liability, you should query the RND before calling a number if you obtained consent in the past. </p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If the RND returns “Yes” (indicating a reassignment), you must not call that number without getting fresh consent, or you risk TCPA penalties. If the RND returns “No,” you have documented proof that the number was good as of the query date, which grants protection in case it was actually reassigned unbeknownst to you. Failing to check the RND when required can lead to unwanted calls to random individuals and potential fines of $500 to $1,500 per call for willful violations of the TCPA. In short, any business that contacts consumers by phone should integrate RND checks into their compliance process to adhere to U.S. regulations and maintain their safe harbor protections.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_2839052e20\"><b>Benefits of Using the RND</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">In addition to being a legal requirement, using the Reassigned Numbers Database provides several important benefits for businesses that engage in outbound calling:</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Avoid TCPA Lawsuits and Fines:</b> Incorporating the RND into your workflow is a cost-efficient way to maintain compliance. It is far cheaper to query the database (which is available via subscription tiers based on query volume) than to deal with the fallout of compliance violations or to manually track number changes. Proactively checking the RND reduces the risk of accidentally calling the wrong person, which in turn lowers your exposure to TCPA litigation. Companies that use the database can demonstrate due diligence and benefit from the FCC’s safe harbor, protecting them if a number was mistakenly marked as safe.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Improve Call Delivery and Contact Rates:</b> Scrubbing your contact lists against the RND means you won’t waste time and resources calling numbers that have been disconnected or reassigned. By eliminating wrong numbers from your campaigns, your calls are more likely to reach the intended recipients – the customers who expect to hear from you. </p></li></ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_e6f573b748\"><b>How Do I Register for the RND? </b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">Before you can submit queries, you must register as a <b>Caller</b> (or <b>Caller Agent</b>) at the official RND portal:</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Go to<a href=\"https://www.reassigned.us/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.reassigned.us\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">https://www.reassigned.us</a> and read the instructions on the “Query” page. To request a login, you must send an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@reassigned.us\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">support@reassigned.us</a>. </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">You must choose a prepaid, tiered subscription based on your expected query volume and preferred term (1-, 3-, 6-, or 12-month).

The benefits of a toll free number are that it has a high throughput and cheaper compliance fees (free to register). The downside is that it is much more difficult to register multiple USA toll free phone numbers than getting many USA Local numbers and the cost per message on Toll Free is slightly higher.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Toll Free Registration Process: <a href=\"https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/10729979-toll-free-verification-request-guide\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/10729979-toll-free-verification-request-guide</a>. </p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">10DLC Fees: <a href=\"https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/5634625-10dlc-fees-and-charges\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/5634625-10dlc-fees-and-charges</a></p><p class=\"no-margin\"><br>Per Message Pricing Local vs Toll Free: <a href=\"https://portal.telnyx.com/#/pricing/messaging\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">https://portal.telnyx.com/#/pricing/messaging</a></p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You also have the option to use a USA Short Code phone number instead of Toll Free or Local if the text message volume is very high and deliverability is a priority.

If you are having a hard time conceptualizing then just think, \"Who does the recipient of the text message think the text message is coming from?\" and that should be the brand. The entity perceived as sending the message should also be the entity who got permission from the recipient to send them a text message. You can create up to 10,000 brands on a Telnyx account. The brand must have a verified status before you can create a campaign.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_6941355861\">2.

An example would be submitting a mixed use case campaign with only 1 sample message. Because a mixed use case has more than 1 sub use case then you are required to have more than 1 sample message to create the campaign.

These rules, which impact <b>originating service providers (OSPs) with a STIR/SHAKEN obligation</b>, will take effect September 18, 2025. It is crucial for Telnyx customers to understand these requirements to ensure compliance and avoid potential service disruptions.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In this Report and Order, the FCC prohibits the use of “third-party authentication,” which it defines as an arrangement in which a provider subject to a STIR/SHAKEN implementation obligation under the Commission’s rules contracts with a third party to perform the technical function of signing calls on the provider’s behalf. The FCC limits permissible third-party authentication arrangements to those in which the provider subject to the STIR/SHAKEN implementation obligation: (1) independently determines attestation levels in accordance with STIR/SHAKEN technical standards, and (2) ensures that all calls are authenticated using its own certificate obtained from a STIR/SHAKEN Certificate Authority, rather than relying on a third party’s certificate. Any use of a third party to sign traffic without meeting these requirements constitutes a <b>violation of the Commission’s caller ID authentication rules</b>.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Additionally, the FCC mandates that any provider certifying to <b>partial or full STIR/SHAKEN implementation in the Robocall Mitigation Database must be registered with the STIR/SHAKEN Policy Administrator</b>, obtain its own SPC token from the Policy Administrator, use that token to generate a certificate with the Certificate Authority, and authenticate all calls using that certificate. </p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_36587608c0\"><b>Who Is Required to Secure Their Own SPC Tokens?</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">The Eighth Report and Order clarifies that <b>originating service providers (OSPs) with control over their network infrastructure</b> must obtain a Service Provider Code (SPC) token from the STIR/SHAKEN Policy Administrator and then present that token to a STIR/SHAKEN Certificate Authority to obtain a certificate.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For Telnyx customers, this means, <b>we will require you to obtain your own SPC token</b> to properly sign and authenticate your calls:</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>If you use both Telnyx and another provider and either:</b></p><ol><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Send calls using numbers from another operator across our network, <b>or</b></p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Send calls from Telnyx numbers across another provider’s network</p></li></ol></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">If you intend to <b>spoof caller ID</b> (which you also may only do so if you are <b>whitelisted</b> for legitimate caller ID spoofing) </p></li></ul><p class=\"no-margin\">However, our internal policies <b>will not require</b> you to obtain an SPC token:</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\">If you <b>exclusively use Telnyx numbers</b> for both origination and termination.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">If you only use a <b>limited number of outside <a href=\"https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/6790265-verified-numbers-faq\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Verified Numbers</a></b>.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n</li></ul><h2 id=\"h_45f5387812\"><b>FCC Compliance and the Robocall Mitigation Database</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">The FCC maintains a record of originating, intermediate, and gateway service providers and their STIR/SHAKEN implementation status in the Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD). In the Eighth Report &amp; Order, the FCC mandates that any OSP certifying that they have \"Partial\" or \"Complete\" STIR/SHAKEN implementation in the RMD must have an SPC token and digital certificate.</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Pure resellers who <b>do not have control over their network infrastructure</b> <b>cannot</b> claim to have <b>“Partial” or “Complete” STIR/SHAKEN Implementation</b> in their RMD filings.</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Instead, these providers must select <b>“No STIR/SHAKEN Implementation”</b> and include an explanatory note indicating their exemption due to a lack of control over the network infrastructure necessary to implement STIR/SHAKEN, pursuant to <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/part-64/subpart-HH#p-64.6305(d)(2)\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">47 CFR 64.6305(d)(2)(i)</a>. </p></li></ul></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">If you have stated in the RMD that your company has “Complete” or “Partial” STIR/SHAKEN implementation, <b>Telnyx will no longer be able to sign calls on your behalf. </b></p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">If you have improperly certified and instead are a <b>pure reseller with no control over the network infrastructure</b>, you must <b>update your RMD registration</b> to properly reflect your status. </p></li></ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_fcaa53dd2a\"><b>Next Steps</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">If you determine that you do qualify as an OSP with a STIR/SHAKEN implementation obligation, you must do the following under the new regulations:</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>STEP ONE: Obtain an OCN (or “Company Code”).</b> Before you can obtain an SPC token, your company must have an Operating Company Number (OCN) from the Nation Exchange Carrier Association (NECA). OCNs are used to uniquely identify telecommunications service providers per industry standard ATIS-</p><p class=\"no-margin\">0300251. NECA assigns all Company Codes. For more information, visit the <a href=\"https://www.neca.org/business-solutions/company-codes\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">NECA website</a>.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>STEP TWO: Register to File 499-A. </b>You must be prepared to file FCC Form 499-A before securing an SPC token. Registration with the Commission includes obtaining an FCC registration number (“FRN”) from the Commission registration system (“CORES”) and obtaining a Filer ID from USAC’s E-File system. Read the <a href=\"https://www.usac.org/wp-content/uploads/service-providers/documents/forms/2025/2025-FCC-Form-499A-Form-Instructions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">2025 Telecommunications Reporting Worksheet Instructions</a> for more information.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>STEP THREE: Register in the Robocall Mitigation Database.</b> Your company must have also a valid active registration in the FCC’s Robocall Mitigation Database (RMD.) As when filing a 499-A, before you can file in the RMD your company must have a CORES account and FRN. For more information on how to file in the RMD, we encourage you to read the FCC’s <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/rmd-instructions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">external filing instructions</a>.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>STEP FOUR: Register with iConectiv.</b> Next, you must register with the Secure Telephone Identity Policy Administrator (STI-PA), which is currently managed by iConectiv. Start by filling out the iConectiv Service Provider registration form available on the STI-PA website. You will need to provide: </p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Legal business name and contact information </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Type of voice service provider (e.g., facilities-based, VoIP, reseller) </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Evidence of your authorization to provide voice services in the U.S. (such as an FCC 499 Filer ID or Operating Company Number) </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">For detailed instructions, refer to the official <a href=\"https://authenticate.iconectiv.com/service-provider-authenticate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">iConectiv Service Provider Guide</a>. iConectiv will walk you through the next steps.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>STEP FIVE: Select a Certificate Authority.</b> Once your organization has successfully activated its account with the STI-PA and received its SPC token, the next step is to select a Certification Authority (CA) authorized by the STI- PA. This CA will issue your organization's STIR/SHAKEN certificate, which is required to begin signing calls under your own identity. The CA will validate your eligibility using the SPC token issued by the STI-PA. Only CAs on the official STI-PA approved list are permitted to issue these certificates.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>STEP SIX: Sign Your Own Calls With Telnyx.</b> After obtaining your STIR/SHAKEN certificate from an approved Certification Authority, you’re ready to begin signing your outbound calls using your own credentials. Telnyx’s Hosted Signing Service will allow you to use your certificate without building signing infrastructure in-house. This service will enable your organization to: </p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Digitally sign calls with your own certificate, meeting industry and regulatory standards; and </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">Maintain full control over attestation levels (A, B, or C) for your U.S. traffic. </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\">For more information on our Hosted Stir/Shaken Product Offering, see our <a href=\"https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/voice/stir-shaken/hosted-cert\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Product Guide</a>. </p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n</li></ul></li></ul><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Disclaimer: The information provided in this Telnyx support article is for general informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal advice.

Request Your Porting Authorization Code (PAC) from Skype</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">To begin the porting process, you’ll need a Porting Authorization Code (PAC) from Skype. This code is necessary to submit alongside your port request.</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Contact Skype Support</b>: Reach out to Skype’s customer support team to request the PAC code.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Verify Your Details</b>: Make sure your Skype Number is linked to your current Skype account and is in good standing (i.e., no unpaid balances).</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"h_501ba8e9a6\"><b>2. Submit Your Porting Request to Telnyx</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">Once you’ve received the PAC code from Skype, you’ll need to submit it to Telnyx to begin the porting process.</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Fill Out Porting Form</b>: <a href=\"https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/1130630-porting-policy-procedure\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Submit your port request</a> with the required details, including your Skype Number, PAC code, and account information.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Choose a Date for Porting</b>: Coordinate with Telnyx to determine when the porting will occur. The porting process usually takes a few days, but it can vary depending on the region and provider.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"h_777b51e934\"><b>3. Prepare for potential Service Disruption</b></h2><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Temporary Service Disruption</b>: During the porting process, there may be a brief disruption in service. We recommend that you inform your contacts about the porting timeline and avoid making critical calls during this time.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Account Maintenance</b>: Ensure that your Skype account remains active and in good standing during the porting process. Any account issues (like pending payments) will delay or disrupt the porting.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"h_4507b289ff\"><b>4. Wait for Porting to Complete</b></h2><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Porting Timeline</b>: The porting process typically takes a few days, but it can take up to a week or longer depending on Skype’s processing of the order.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Monitor Your Number</b>: While the porting process is in progress, Skype may send you notifications, and Telnyx will also notify you when the porting is complete.</p></li></ul><h2 id=\"h_ccfe0f01be\"><b>5. Confirm Successful Porting</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">Once the porting is complete, Telnyx will notify you that your Skype Number has been successfully transferred.</p><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Test Your Number</b>: Once ported, you should test your Skype Number with Telnyx to ensure that it is active and receiving calls correctly.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Skype Service Deactivation</b>: After the porting is complete, your Skype Number will no longer be associated with your Skype account. If you no longer wish to use Skype, make sure to deactivate your Skype account or cancel any associated services.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"h_1ac83ab396\"><b>Things to Keep in Mind</b></h2><ul><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Porting Fees</b>: Skype may charge a fee for porting your number. Make sure to check Skype’s pricing for number porting before proceeding.  Telnyx does not charge Port In Fees.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>No Porting for Non-Skype Numbers</b>: Only Skype Numbers can be ported to Telnyx. If you have a regular Skype account with a non-Skype number, it cannot be transferred to Telnyx.</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Keep Your Account Active</b>: It’s essential to keep your Skype account active until the porting process is completed to avoid any disruptions. If your Skype account is suspended or canceled before porting is finalized, the transfer may fail.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=\"h_8c8a4bdd5d\"><b>Contact Telnyx Support</b></h2><p class=\"no-margin\">If you need any assistance during the porting process, Telnyx’s support team is available to help you.

For SIP traffic, SRV records enable the distribution of SIP requests across multiple hosts, providing load balancing and failover capabilities.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_ed6dadcbb0\"><b>Where are SRV records used?</b></h3><p class=\"no-margin\">SRV (Service) records in DNS are used in two different scenarios: </p><ol><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>SIP FQDN Connections</b>: the FQDN(s) of the Connection indicate Telnyx where to route Inbound calls. </p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Voice API calls to external domains:</b> Customers can dial or transfer calls to external non Telnyx FQDNs.</p></li></ol><p class=\"no-margin\"><br>Both of these FQDNs might have SRV records configured that Telnyx will honor.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<hr><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_28ee2c79f9\"><b>How Telnyx Handles SRV Records</b></h3><p class=\"no-margin\">When Telnyx receives a request to route a call to an external non Telnyx FQDN, it determines how to route the call based on the DNS records of the FQDN. This behavior depends on whether a port is specified in the RURI. <b>Telnyx will select the appropriate SRV record based on the transport protocol used in the SIP request</b>.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>RURI with a Port Number</b></p><p class=\"no-margin\">If the RURI contains a port number<b> </b>(e.g. <code>sip:+1234567890@sip.example.com:5060</code>):</p><ol><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>DNS Lookup:</b> Telnyx performs an A-record lookup, bypassing the SRV record.<br>​</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Routing: </b>The call is routed to the IP address returned by the A-record lookup.</p></li></ol><p class=\"no-margin\"><br>​</p><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>RURI Without a Port Number</b></p><p class=\"no-margin\">If the RURI does not contain a port number (e.g. <code>sip:+1234567890@sip.example.com</code>):</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<ol><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>DNS Lookup:</b> Telnyx performs an SRV-record lookup.<br>​</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Routing:</b> The SRV record dictates the server to which the call should be routed. If no SRV record exists, Telnyx will fall back to an A-record lookup and use the default SIP port (5060 for UDP/TCP or 5061 for TLS). If the first SRV target fails with a SIP 503 response, Telnyx will attempt the next highest priority target in the SRV list<br>​</p></li></ol><hr><h3 id=\"h_3fbb74b86e\"><br><b>Key Considerations for Configuring SIP Calls</b></h3><ol><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Remove Port Numbers for SRV Record Range</b><br>To leverage SRV records, ensure the to header in your dial command does not include a port number. For example:<br><br>- Incorrect:  <b> </b><code>\"to\" =&gt; \"sip:+1234567890@sip.example.com:5060\"</code><br><br>- Correct: <code>\"to\" =&gt; \"sip:+1234567890@sip.example.com\"</code><br>​</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Fallback Behaviour</b><br>If an SRV record is not found:<br><br>- Telnyx attempts an A-record lookup.<br><br>- If no A-record exists, the call fails with a <code>SIP 478 (Unresolvable Destination) response</code>.<br>​</p></li><li><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>DNS Resolvability</b><br><br>- Ensure your DNS configuration is correct and resolvable globally.<br><br>- Ensure SRV targets are properly configured with resolvable A records.  <br>​</p></li></ol><hr><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_24df161853\"><b>Example Use Case</b></h3><p class=\"no-margin\">A customer configures their to header with a domain and port,  where the domain <b>sip.example.com</b> is an SRV record:</p><p class=\"no-margin\"><br><code>\"to\" =&gt; \"sip:+1234567890@sip.example.com:5060\"</code></p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This results in an A-record lookup, which fails because there is no A-record for sip.example.com.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"><br><b>Solution:</b></p><p class=\"no-margin\">Remove the port number to allow SRV record processing</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><code>\"to\":\"sip:+1234567890@sip.example.com\"</code></p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This change enables Telnyx to perform an SRV lookup, correctly routing the call based on the SRV record.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<hr><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_f57272417f\"><b>Summary</b></h3><p class=\"no-margin\">Customers should use SRV records for load balancing and failover by omitting the port number in the SIP \"to\" headers. You should ensure that DNS records (SRV and A records) are configured and resolvable, and if calls fail with a 478 response please verify that no port number is included in the RURI and that the SRV records are properly configured. </p>","author_id":4697519,"state":"published","created_at":1740663252,"updated_at":1740664777,"url":"https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/10666839-how-telnyx-handles-srv-records-for-sip-calls"}]}
